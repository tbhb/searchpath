## Inspirations

The [pathspec](https://python-path-specification.readthedocs.io/) library provides the gitignore pattern matching that powers searchpath's optional `GitignoreMatcher`.

Python's [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) module provides the foundation for searchpath's path handling. The library complements pathlib's glob feature with ordered directory searching and provenance tracking.

## AI help

The development of this library involved AI language models, specifically [Claude](https://claude.ai). AI tools contributed to drafting code, tests, and documentation. Human authors made all design decisions and final implementations, and they reviewed, edited, and validated AI-generated content. The authors take full responsibility for the correctness of this software.
